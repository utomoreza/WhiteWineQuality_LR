# Learning by Building RM (Regression Model)

This repo consists of all folders and files needed for the project of Regression Model for Predicting White Wine Quality. The dataset used is downloaded from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).

The programming language used in this repo is Python. I wrote a notebook in Jupyter notebook. `notebook not published yet`. If you prefer to read the notebook in R language, you could see it [here](https://github.com/utomoreza/RM_LBB). However, unlike this repo, I used **RED** wine dataset, instead of the white one, for the R notebook.

I published this notebook on Kaggle. You can view it [here](). `not published yet`
